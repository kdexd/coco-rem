Introducing COCO-ReM, a set of high-quality instance annotations for COCO images.
COCO-ReM improves on imperfections prevailing in COCO-2017 such as coarse mask boundaries, non-exhaustive annotations, inconsistent handling of occlusions, and duplicate masks.
Masks in COCO-ReM have a visibly better quality than COCO-2017, as shown below.
